ðŸ“¦ Requirements & Their Purpose
1. transformers
What is it?
A library from Hugging Face that provides access to pre-trained transformer models like BERT, GPT, etc.

Why is it used?
You use it to load and fine-tune a BERT model for sentiment analysis, tokenize input text, and apply a classification head for sentiment prediction.

Model Used:
bert-base-uncased or any other fine-tuned BERT model for sentiment classification.

2. torch (or tensorflow, depending on your backend)
What is it?
A deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.

Why is it used?
Used for model training, forward pass, loss calculation, and backpropagation during fine-tuning of BERT for sentiment classification.

3. pandas
What is it?
A data manipulation library in Python.

Why is it used?
Used for loading, preprocessing, and handling datasets (e.g., CSV, Parquet files with tweets or reviews).

4. numpy
What is it?
A fundamental library for numerical operations.

Why is it used?
Used for vector operations, matrix manipulation, and efficient numerical computations during training and evaluation.

5. scikit-learn
What is it?
A Python library for machine learning utilities and evaluation metrics.

Why is it used?
Used for calculating accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and for splitting the dataset into train/test.

6. matplotlib / seaborn (Optional)
What is it?
Libraries for data visualization.

Why is it used?
Used for plotting training loss curves, confusion matrices, and visualizing dataset distribution.
